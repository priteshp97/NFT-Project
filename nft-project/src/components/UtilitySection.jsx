              The original Kingz. These were the first KaijuKingz to be minted,
              and the only ones capable of generating 5 $RWASTE a day. Currently
              $RWASTE can be used to name Kaijuz, write lore for Kaijuz, and
              even to create a Baby Kaiju by Fuzing the DNA from two Genesis
              Kaijuz. As the project and community develops, there will be even
              further utilization of $RWASTE, making Genesis Kaijuz the
              foundation for all things to come. All 3333 Genesis Kaijuz have
              been completely minted and there will never be any more created.

            <h3>Baby Kaijuz</h3>
            <p>
              Created from mutating the fuzed DNA of two Genesis Kaijuz. There
              is a maximum of 6,666 of these monsters to be created. Although
              Baby Kaijuz require DNA from two separate Genesis Kaijuz to be
              created, they do not inherit traits from them. Instead, Baby
              Kaijuz mutate traits of their own, and can even be born with belly
              and spike colors that are different from their body colors. More
              will be revealed about Baby Kaijuz as Augminted Labs continues
              studying them over time.

            <p>
              Feast your eyes on some of the rarest KaijuKingz in the
              collection: the Legendary Kaijuz. Only 10 of these mythical beasts
              exist, and they are all unique 1/1 special edition Kaijuz with
              animations exclusive to them. One Legendary Kaiju, the Mecha
              Kaiju, was exclusively auctioned off, only allowing holders of
              N0XSCAPE Founders Cards to participate in the auction. Another one
              of these special Legends was tucked away in the initial mint of
              KaijuKingz for one lucky degen to find. After all KaijuKingz were
              minted, the final 8 were auctioned off.

              The KaijuKingz community DAO will use the community vault to plan
              how Talent Grants will be utilized, who will be qualified to
              receive them, and how they will be scheduled. Aspiring creators
              can apply for grants that will give them the resources needed to

            <h2>DAO FORMATION</h2>
            <p>
              The KaijuKingz DAO will help create a community focused on
              deciding the direction of KaijuKingz, the expansion of its
              ecosystem, and how to curate and strengthen the best of technical
              and creative talent to develop Web3 and NFTs. KaijuKingz sales
              will go into the community vault, which will be used to issue
              grants and scholarships to talented applicants within the
              community. Why go for a DAO structure? Because all Kingz deserve
              to have their voices heard. Each KaijuKing will bestow voting
              power upon their holders within the ecosystem, allowing for truly
              decentralized decision making.
            </p>
            <p className="roadmap-1-p">
              Kingz are destined for greatness - some just need a little help to
              truly become radiant. The KaijuKingz DAO will review applicants
              from those aspiring to make their dreams a reality. Chosen by
              community vote, those that are approved will receive a grant to
              cover living expenses and a boot camp that will drill the skills
              required to flourish.
