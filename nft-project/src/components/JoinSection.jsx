            The KaijuKingz creed is to create, protect, and rule together. We
            aim to help in the development of Web3 and other creatives, focusing
            on the NFT ecosystem in particular. We hope to deliver life changing
            scholarships and development grants through our KaijuKingz DAO;
            created first and foremost by and for the KaijuKingz community to
            enrich the Web3 and creative landscape. See how you can help, or
            even participate as a scholarship applicant.
